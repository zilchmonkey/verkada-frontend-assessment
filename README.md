# Verkada frontend assessment

### Overview

This project is based on a frontend assessment test for Verkada. The task involved replicating a design provided in a Figma file using React and SCSS, but instead of SCSS this project uses tailwind CSS.

Spacing and fonts are not entirely accurate, but I hope this will be of help!

As a bonus the form also filters the bottom list by it's title.
